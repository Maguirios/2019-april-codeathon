# Venezuelan Diaspora - Solidarity System Indicators

## Who we are
NEXT-STEP is an organization offering a microfinance program, with experience in Venezuela.
The Red Humanitaria de los Caminantes, is a network of entities in Colombia that provides charity services for the “caminantes” (“walkers”), Venezuelans on the go, emigrating to or through Colombia.

## Problem statement
Over 3 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland and are working to get settled in a new country. There is a need to support this community and having basic information about them will be key to developing and deploying solutions.

## Challenge

In that sense, we aim to tackle the “trust challenge” and by inviting participants to the hackathon to develop the following indicators over a Community platform:

- Generate a data asset on where are Venezuelans. Find open data sources to create a dataset of where Venezuelans have migrated.
- Create a data visualization front-end.
- Create a Registration flow with geolocation verification indicator: a starts or bar index of how certain is the system that the user is in the location that the user claim to be.
- Regional humanitarian need indicator: a humanitarian index able to provide an indication off the level of social assistance required at the location where the individual is located (e.g. an index proportionally inverse to the social development index)
- Regional Work and Entrepreneurial Assistant indicator: an index to understand the economic context in terms of availability of employment (unemployment) or entrepreneurial means at the location of the individual.
- Services recomendability indicator: a recommender system with a start or bar indicator for the organizations or entities providing services presented in list by region and by region matching the geolocation of a particular individual.
